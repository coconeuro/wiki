tl;dr

$ Create an SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

$ Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Then select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file
# displayed in the terminal to your clipboard

In github, go to Settings -> Access -> SSH and GPG keys -> Add SSH key


# The .git/config file should have these entries:
# Example shown for the ccc repository

[remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:coconeuro/ccc.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[user]
        name = your_github_username
        email = your_email@example.com



# If you have multiple Github Accounts, each with a SSH key

$ Create an SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Enter a filename of the form ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.github-profilename
# where profilename is the name you give to this SSH key

$ Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.github-profilename

# The .git/config file should have these entries:
# Example shown for the ccc repository

[remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com-profilename:coconeuro/ccc.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

# In your ~/.ssh/config
# for each Profile, enter an entry of the form

#GitHub: profilename
Host github.com-profilename
        HostName github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.github-profilename
